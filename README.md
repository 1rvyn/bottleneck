# I/O Performance Benchmarks Across Languages

This project explores the often-overlooked aspect of programming language performance: I/O bandwidth. While many benchmarks focus on computational throughput, the reality is that for many real-world applications, I/O operations are the primary bottleneck.

## Overview

Inspired by the viral "1 Billion Row Challenge" that originated in the Java ecosystem, this project takes a systematic approach to measuring I/O performance across multiple languages including C, C++, Go, and Rust. Rather than focusing purely on computation or memory management, these benchmarks specifically target I/O-bound workloads to provide insights into how different languages handle file operations.

## Why I/O Benchmarks Matter

Most modern performance comparisons between languages like Zig, Go, and Rust focus heavily on computational throughput, memory usage, and algorithmic efficiency. However, they often overlook a crucial aspect: how efficiently can these languages move data in and out of the system?

## Implementation Details

The benchmark suite includes three different I/O patterns implemented in each language:
- Raw file I/O
- Buffered I/O
- Stream-based operations

Each implementation processes the same input file (approximately 1GB in size) to ensure consistent comparison. The benchmarks are designed to:
- Minimize the impact of CPU-bound operations
- Focus on raw I/O performance
- Account for different I/O strategies commonly used in each language

Special attention has been paid to ensure that the benchmarks:
- Run on consistent hardware configurations
- Account for system-level variations
- Provide reproducible results
